# Hacknet-Ext-BuildTool
Hacknet is a fun game that I want to make an extension for.
However, I also need a job, and making free DLC for a game that has an average playerbase of ~450 players does not seem like a sound strategy.

So instead, in the spirit of learning fullstack development, I'm going to build a full Hacknet Extension Builder.

I know no coder cares about this sort of thing, but I'm entering this not knowing JACK about what I'm about to embark upon.
I am 33/33/33 on whether:
  - This is incredibly difficult to do (and I am at the peak of Dunning-Kruger)
  - This already exists, and the community is so small that anyone who knows about this already has downloaded some creator tool
  - This is a game with less than 450 concurrent players at a given moment, why would anyone make this
  
In any case, now that I've voiced my trepidation, let's try to work out what it is we'll be doing.
