Hacknet is a game made in 2015 centered around hacking networks.
It is meant***** to simulate actual hacking, but also in a cool sci-fi way a-la the movie Hackers (1995)

The general gist is that I want to make a tool for building extensions - those being fan-made campaigns.
I do not know if such a tool already exists, however, if it does then they should probably advertise it more on the hacknet Server.

It will probably be coded in Python (why not)
