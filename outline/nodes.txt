The following is each piece of info usable in building a node.
(from https://pastebin.com/NwtgTdPW)
Each one has:
- What it is
- Datatype / How it will be stored on SQL
- Any Restrictions

Declaration of Node:
<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8" ?>
<Computer [general-information]>[everything-else]</Computer>

PRIMARY KEY: (?)
    sql_id uuid GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY generate_uuid_v4()

General Information:
    
    id="idHere"
        id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
        
        This is for everyhing else, how the engine identifies the computer.
    
    name="nameHere"
        name VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT "set this"

        How it will appear to the user

    ip="1.1.1.1"
        ip VARCHAR(40) DEFAULT generate_random_ip()

        String, generate 4 random values from 1 to 100 if not set, join with periods.

    security="num"
        security SMALLINT DEFAULT 0

        must be between 0 and 5.  No I do not know how the game reads it and it get's promptly overridden later.
        CHECK( security BETWEEN 0 and 5 )

    allowsDefaultBootModule="false/true"
        aDBM BOOLEAN DEFAULT false

        Boots up a daemon if the computer has a daemon.

    icon="chip"
        icon SMALLINT NOTNULL
        CHECK icon BETWEEN 0 AND 12

        Refer to a reference table such that:
        0: laptop
        1: chip
        2: kellis
        3: tablet
        4: ePhone
        5: ePhone2
        6: Psylance
        7: PacificAir
        8: Alchemist
        9: DLCLaptop
        10: DLCPC1
        11: DLCPC2
        12: DLCServer

    type="num"
        type SMALLINT NOT NULL
        CHECK type BETWEEN 1 and 4

    accounts SUBTABLE
        See accounts subtable.
        - sql_id FOREIGN KEY
        - username VARCHAR(255)
        - password VARCHAR(255)
        - type INT BETWEEN 0 and 3
        
    ports + portRemap:
        ports hstore

        How it's going to work:
        keys are going to be ports, then their values are going to be the ports
